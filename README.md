Project Objective: 

  In every city (especially metropolitan ones), property values at the center or waterfront properties tend to be expensive—sometimes into the millions of dollars. As you leave the hubbub of downtown, home prices start to drop. Eventually, the “rough” parts of the cities see a plummet in home evaluation due to reputation, crime, among other causes.

  Eventually, prices will rise once again as the location crosses the border of the city into the suburbs. At some point there is a turn—an inflection—that shall be dubbed “the home value valley.” This project seeks to visualize the Home Value Valley of several municipalities (and counties) of various locations within the US and determine what, if anything, they say about the population therein.

  This project will focus on using home value assessments rather than taxes. While taxes can be a good general indicator of what a property is worth (especially since taxes in cities are uniform), they are not useful without knowing other factors. Assessment is more-or-less a complete picture of how much a piece of property is actually worth. Additionally, suburbs may have different taxes than their neighboring cities, and are incomplete.

  The ultimate product of this project will be several visualizations within the US, along with a write-up detailing some of the more interesting findings we discover.
